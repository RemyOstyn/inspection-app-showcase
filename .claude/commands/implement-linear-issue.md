Read @CLAUDE.md, pick up linear.app issue #$ARGUMENTS , read it carefully, plan your implementation based on requirements, and implement it.
Once implementation is done, run typescript check, lint and fix if there is any issue then give me the list of what to test on the frontend.
Don't run the frontend by yourself.
Once I approve your implementation, Update the linear.app issue #$ARGUMENTS with what has been done, and mark it as done.
